# Mage Gauntlet !

Welcome to my game called Mage Gauntlet (name is subject to change). Essentially there are a few controls to be aware of for this game to work out properly. 

The game starts by having your character team spawn with 3 people, these guys all have 3 individual spells. On the opposing side there will be monsters who will attack your characters randomly. 

After a few waves you'll get the chance to shop before facing a boss who has a unique moveset of their own. 

# For the Gameplay

While it's your turn, press 6 to enter the enemy targetting system. While in this mode you can press numbers 1 - 3 in order to select your target, then you can press 1 - 3 again to select what move you'd like to use. 

To use your Inventory, you can press 7 to enter it. Once in your inventory numbers 1 - 3 will let you choose which team member you'd like to use your item on. Once that is selected you can press numbers 1 - 5 to select which item from your inventory you'd like to use. 

That should be about it for controls, if anything new updates will appear in the readme.
